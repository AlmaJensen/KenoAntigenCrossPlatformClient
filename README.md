# KenoAntigenCrossPlatformClient
This is a client for a new game called Keno Antigen.  This client runs on iOS, Android, Windows 8 and 10, and windows Mobile.  Mac OS support will be added later.

This software is free and open for anyone to use or modify.  

This software runs using Xamarin technology.  The UI is written using Xamarin Forms and Xaml.  Check out Xamarin.com for more information on setup and use.

A couple of quick notes.  Xamarin has a free community edition.  On Windows you can use Visual Studio Community edition or Xamarin Studio.
On Mac you'll need Xamarin Studio.  

Each of the projects still makes use of native tools.  For iOS you'll have to have a Mac to be able to run or build the project.  The windows
projects can only be run and built from a Windows computer and only from Visual Studio.  The Android project can be built on Mac or Windows.

The iOS project requires xCode.  The Android project requires the Android SDKs be installed.
